To map a USB device to a specific COM port in Ubuntu, you can create a UDEV rule. This rule will create a symbolic link to the device, allowing you to access it using a consistent name like /dev/COM5. 
Here's a step-by-step guide: 
Identify the device:
You can use lsusb to list connected USB devices and find the vendor ID (idVendor) and product ID (idProduct) of your device. For example:
Code

     lsusb -v | grep -i "Prolific"
Code

     lsusb -v | grep -i "idProduct"
You might also see the device listed in /dev/ttyACM* or similar. 
Create the UDEV rule file:
Open a terminal and navigate to /etc/udev/rules.d:
Code

     cd /etc/udev/rules.d
Create a new rule file. For example, COM5.rules: 
Code

     sudo nano 99-arm1.rules
Add the UDEV rule:
In the file, add a line that specifies the device's vendor and product IDs, along with the desired COM port name. For example: 
Code

SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1a86", ATTRS{idProduct}=="7523", SYMLINK+="arm1", MODE="0666"
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="067b", ATTRS{idProduct}=="23a3", SYMLINK+="arm1", MODE="0666"

     
Replace "067b" and "2303" with the actual vendor and product IDs from your lsusb output.
Replace "COM5" with the desired COM port name (e.g., COM1, COM2, etc.).
Reload UDEV rules:
Save the file and reload the UDEV rules:
Code

     sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
     sudo udevadm trigger

1. Reboot (optional):
A reboot may be necessary for the changes to take effect, but it's often not required.
2. Test:
After the changes are applied, you should be able to access the device as /dev/COM5 in your software.

ls -l /dev/arm1


Explanation:
SUBSYSTEM=="tty": Specifies that this rule applies to serial devices.
ATTRS{idVendor}=="067b": Matches the vendor ID of the device.
ATTRS{idProduct}=="2303": Matches the product ID of the device.
SYMLINK+="COM5": Creates a symbolic link named COM5 pointing to the device. 


Important Considerations:
COM port conflicts:
Be sure to choose a COM port number that isn't already in use by another device or program.
udevadm info:
You can use udevadm info --name=/dev/ttyACMx --attribute-walk to get detailed information about a USB device, including its attributes. This can be helpful for identifying the correct vendor and product IDs for your rule.
Persistent mapping:
This method provides a persistent mapping, meaning the device will be recognized as the specified COM port each time it's plugged in, regardless of the physical port it's connected to. 




     cd /etc/udev/rules.d
     sudo nano 99-arm1.rules


SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="067b", ATTRS{idProduct}=="23a3", SYMLINK+="arm1", MODE="0666"

     sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
     sudo udevadm trigger


ls -l /dev/arm1
ls: cannot access '/dev/arm1': No such file or directory



The PL2303 driver needs explicit binding for this device:

# Unbind any existing driver
sudo modprobe -r pl2303
sudo modprobe pl2303

# Force bind using vendor/product ID
echo "067b 23a3" | sudo tee /sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/pl2303/new_id

# Verify
dmesg | tail -n 5
